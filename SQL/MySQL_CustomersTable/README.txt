MySQL Customers Table

This project allows the user to add to a table (customers) in a database
and also shows the table in a HTML file. The HTML file also lets the user
change the background colour of the table. Just run the main.py file, then
if you don't want to change anything press N. If you do want to add a row
in the table, press Y and enter the details. Then, enter the sorting column
(name, address, or ID) and the program will open the file in a new tab in
Chrome. You can enter a colour in the text input box as the name (e.g.
'red', 'blue', 'yellowgreen') or as '#' followed by the hex code (e.g.
'#FF0000', '#0000FF', '#9ACD32'), then press 'switch' to change the
background colour of the table.
