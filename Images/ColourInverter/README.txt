Colour Inverter

This program takes in a file and can do one of 6 things:

  [1] Invert to BGR
  [2] Darken image
  [3] Lighten image
  [4] Boost Red
  [5] Boost Green
  [6] Boost Blue

Type in the desired option and press return. The formatted
image will then be shown on your screen. It will also be
saved as a file in the same location as the original image,
and in the same format as the original image. Note that if
the file is stored in a different location from the program
you will need to input the exact location (e.g.
C://User_Name/Pictures/Path_To/my_file.png) or use '../' to
go back one folder (e.g. ../../Pictures/Path_To/my_file.png).

The Python logo is saved as PyLogo.png in this folder.
