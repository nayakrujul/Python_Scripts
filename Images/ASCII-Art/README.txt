ASCII Art

Enter the file name and see the image displayed as ASCII Art
This is ASCII characters (letters, numbers, symbols) used in
different places due to the darkness of each pixel in the
image, and the area filled by the character. This will only
work on a dark console background, otherwise the colours will
be inverted. For example: the character '.' does not fill much
area, therefore exposing more black. You can use it for a
darker pixel. The character '$' fills a lot of area, therefore
not exposing much black, meaning you can use it for a lighter
pixel. Run 'main.py'. There is an example file already called
'test_img.png' which you can use, or copy an image into the
same folder and use that filename. The ASCII Art will be
displayed on the console and also written to the file
'image.txt'. This already contains the ASCII Art for the
example image. You will need to install the following
packages: opencv-python; colorama. This program was written by
nayakrujul (github.com/nayakrujul) in Python 3.9.9 in Jan 2022,
but this program will work on any version in after 3.0
