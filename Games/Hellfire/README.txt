Hellfire

This game is about avoiding the missiles. There is
a 20 col x 5 row screen where you are limited to
the first column. You can move up and down in that
column. The missiles will stay in one row as they
approach you. Use the up and down arrow keys to
dodge out of the way. The game starts at 3 blocks
per second but gets 0.5 blocks per second faster
every 10 blocks. You get 1 point per block. The aim
is to reach a score of 200 points.
