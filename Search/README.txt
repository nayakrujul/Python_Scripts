This program is similar to my Sort
program, however this compares Binary
Search with Linear Search. You can
access it in a similar way to the
Sort program - change the constants
at the start of get_data.py and run
it to get your data in times.csv
(once again this appends to the file
so delete the data that's already
there).

To get the graph, run main.py. The
output from my results is stored in
Graph.png. It gives the raw data for
Binary Search (orange) and Linear
Search (light green), and the best fit
lines for both (red and dark green
respectively). The best fit lines are
given because the linear search depends
purely on the index of the element in
the list so it it prone to volatility.

You will need matplotlib and numpy
installed (`pip install matplotlib`
installs them both).
